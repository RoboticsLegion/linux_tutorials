# Linux Tutorials

## Description

Unlike Windows, the Unix family operating systems including Linux and BSD are open-source and free in addition to the focus on using the terminal instead of graphical user interfaces (UIs).

Linux is part of Unix OSs and Ubuntu is a debian-based distribution of Linux. Linux is to Windows what manual cars are to the automatic ones. It offers more security and low-level access to the hardware and I/Os which makes it preferable to developers. Windows updates and idiotic releases are a headache for everyone and there seems to be no promising solutions in the future. 

Working with Linux might seem a bit confusing and unnatural at first, but once you get hands on commands and features, you'll realize the benefits and perks of using a Unix-based OS for your system and development.
